# Coding Paradise

It is a learning platform that helps a person to study coding.

In this era, where a large number of resources are available to learn things, it is difficult to find out which resources are best and what are the right order to learn them.

To solve this problem, we created a website named as coding paradise which acts as a junction between learners and resources by providing them right resources in the right order from all over the internet.

It involves resources for different coding fields like 

1. Programming Languages(C,Python,Java)
2. Frontend Development
3. Backend Development
4. Data Structures
5. Algorithm etc


This project aims to help all kind of learners whether it be a student or some IT professional as it contains questions and notes from easy to advance range.
